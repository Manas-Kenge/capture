# Welcome to Capture contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [Capture](https://github.com/khattakdev/capture) :sparkles: .

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

Before making code contributions, make sure to set up your development environment. Please follow the project's documentation for specific instructions.


### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the Capture, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/khattakdev/capture/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in a codespace

Make your code changes on this branch. Ensure your changes adhere to our coding guidelines. 

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update to **Node.js**, at the version specified in `.node-version`. For more information, see the development guide.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Capture team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Capture team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the Capture.

Now that you are part of the Capture community, see how else you can contribute to the docs.
